        This box adjusts its width based on its content.

      <div class="normal-box">This box has a fixed width.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The fit-content property in CSS is used to adjust the size of an element
      based on its content. This property can be particularly useful when you
      want the element to be as wide as its content without specifying a fixed
      width.
